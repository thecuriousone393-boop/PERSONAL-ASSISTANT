🧠 Basic Logic Behind Each Module
1️⃣ Expense Tracker

Data stored in SQLite table expenses.

Each expense = title + amount + category + date.

Add expense → Insert into DB.

List expenses → SELECT * FROM expenses ORDER BY id DESC.

Delete expense → DELETE FROM expenses WHERE id = ?.

Total expenses → SUM(amount) query.

2️⃣ To-Do List

Stored in SQLite table todos.

Each task has id + task + done (0/1).

Add task → Insert with done = 0.

Mark done → Update row with done = 1.

Delete task → Remove row by id.

3️⃣ Quiz Game

Questions are stored in a Python list (quiz.py).

Each question = {id, question, options[], answer_index}.

User clicks option → JS sends choice → Flask checks if chosen index == answer.

Returns {"correct": True/False} → Display result instantly.

4️⃣ Chatbot

Very simple rule-based chatbot.

User message stored in DB chats (role=user, message).

Bot checks for keywords:

"hello" → Greeting

"time" → Current time

"joke" → Small joke

"help" → Available features

Else → "Sorry, I don’t understand."

Bot’s reply also stored in DB (role=bot, message).

5️⃣ Weather Module

Uses OpenWeather API.

User enters city → JS sends request to Flask → Flask calls API with requests.

Response parsed → city, temp, description, humidity, wind.

If API key missing or city invalid → return error message.







🖥️ Usage

Home Page → Navigate to different modules.

Expenses → Enter title, amount, category, and date → Add expense.

To-Do → Add tasks → Mark done or delete.

Quiz → Click an option → See if it’s correct or wrong.

Chatbot → Send a message → Get bot response.

Weather → Enter city name → Fetch weather details.
